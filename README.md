# paella-button-remover
The opencast paella web player displays an unmistakably large play button while the playback is paused. This makes reading small texts or inspecting detailed images really annoying. The paella-button-remover chrome extension offers a quick solution by hiding this play button.

# INSTALLATION
1. Download the repository
2. Open chrome and go to 'chrome://extensions'
3. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the downloaded directory

# USAGE
If the currently opened tab contains the paella web player the extension will be activated (the icon will apear in full color). If you want to remove the play button just click on the paella-button-remover icon in the top left corner of chrome (next to all of your other extensions). Now the play button should disappear.
